		<h3>Lesley Flanigan</h3>

			palette of noise and subtle imperfections. Her work has been presented at
			venues and festivals internationally, including The Red Bull Music
			Festival at Saint John the Divine (New York), De Doelen (Rotterdam), Sonar
			(Barcelona), The Pritzker Pavilion at Millennium Park (Chicago), the

			experimental composition to progressively blend the old with the new. A
			strong believer in the freedom of speech and the arts as an amplifier of
			expression, her compositional work often integrates recorded testimonies
			with resilient individuals, features field recordings of place, and aims
