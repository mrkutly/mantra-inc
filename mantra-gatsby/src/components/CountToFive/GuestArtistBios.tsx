		<h3>Andie Tanning</h3>
		<p>Andie Tanning is a violinist and performer.</p>
		<p>
			She is the cofounder and musical director of Wild Shore New Music, now in
			its seventh year as Alaska’s premier new music festival. She released her
			debut album, “Dandelion,” in December 2018. Steve Dollar of the National
			Sawdust Log writes, “The stylistically diverse Dandelion is not only a
			scrapbook of Tanning’s experiences and influences, but also an open and
			always surprising collaboration with composers and video artists whose
			spirits are illuminated through the violinist’s intrepid musicianship and
			exploratory nature.”
		</p>
		<p>
			She has toured internationally as a company member of the New York City
			Players, has served as a multi-instrumentalist in theater groups Object
			Collection and New Paradise Laboratories, was the fiddle player in the
			musical, The Snow Child, by John Strand, Georgia Stitt and Bob Banghart,
			and was a violin sub in the Broadway revival of Oklahoma!. Ongoing musical
			collaborations include a duo with guitarist James Moore, the minimalist
			rock band Thee Reps, and the development of a new opera by Aaron Siegel.
			Her album with James Moore, “Gertrudes,” was released on New World Records
			in 2016. She has performed at LA Opera, The Kitchen, The Pompidou, and
			Carnegie Hall.

		<h3>TRANSIT New Music</h3>
		<p>
			Taking their cues from the diversity of the city around them, the artists
			of TRANSIT seek to create bridges between and among the various schools
			and styles of music being written and performed today, while embracing
			innovative projects that are relevant to contemporary culture. Their goal
			is not to achieve an international style or to promote a particular
			“sound.” Rather, they champion experimental music from a wide range of
			influences with the conviction that the music of today is inherently
			meaningful to audiences and vital to social progress. Paired with superior
			artistry, shrewd programming, and radically open ears, this determination
			keeps TRANSIT firmly rooted at the cutting edge of new music.
		</p>
		<p>
			Formed in 2007, TRANSIT has established a reputation for producing
			exciting concerts featuring young composers and for special projects that
			push the boundaries of musical convention. Through the DoubleBill Series,
			TRANSIT has worked closely with emerging composers from around the globe
			and presented world premiere-studded concerts for audiences throughout New
			York City. In special projects, the collective has experimented with
			concepts as disparate as binary-gated amplification (Tristan Perich),
			music for hearing-deprived musicians (Eric KM Clark), large-scale
			multimedia shows (Daniel Wohl), and music for hand-built speaker feedback
			instruments (Lesley Flanigan). TRANSIT has performed at Le Poisson Rouge,
			Issue Project Room, and Galapagos Art Space; for the MATA Interval,
			Astoria Music Society, and Darmstadt Classics of the Avant Garde series;
			and on joint programs alongside artists including So Percussion, Judy
			Dunaway, Arutro en el Barco, and Margaret Leng Tan. TRANSIT has also been
			a resident ensemble at the CUNY Graduate Center (City University of New
			York).
		</p>
		<p>
			In all its endeavors, TRANSIT remains committed to breaking down barriers
			between living composers and the culture at large while maintaining the
			dignity of both.
		</p>
		<p>
			TRANSIT appreciates the support of the Brooklyn Arts Council, the New York
			City Department of Cultural Affairs, Meet the Composer, Jerome Foundation,
			the American Composers Forum, the New York State Council on the Arts, and
			the Puffin Foundation.
