Her work as an activist for women\'s rights, sexual freedom, political freedom, workers\' rights and more, paved the way for generations of activists and social change to follow. In this new opera, a concert-length work for female vocalist and percussion sextet, composer and librettist Annie Gosfield ties the many radical threads of Goldman\'s life together into an inspiring, thought-provoking, and powerful work.'
